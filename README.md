# Personal Website Portfolio Project

This is my personal website and it was created using Svelte, Vite, and Tailwind. I decided to try to make a website portfolio after working at an internship where I got my first hands-on experience doing frontend web dev.
I figured I'd first tackle a static website that won't be changing any time soon and then try another project that requires a little more full-stack development skill and interaction.
But yeah this is it, hopefully you think it's cool, send it along to your friends if you think it's cool (or ugly and you want to roast me ;-;) ! !

## Technical considerations

**Why use this over SvelteKit?**

- Svelte brings its own routing solution which might not be preferable for some users.
- Allegedly deploying to Github Pages is really annoying / not possible (?) with SvelteKit
- It's cool

**Why use this over plain JS, CSS, and HTML?**

- I had just finished working on a project using SvelteKit for an internship and so I was very familiar with Svelte.
- Svelte has a lot of really nice syntax that helps make javascript look so much cleaner and readable.
- Standard HTML and CSS look so ugly so Tailwind is a must (I am not going to spend 20 hours writing out CSS style tags).

## Other Notes

- This is my first time trying to make an actual personal website so it's a bit scuffed
- I'm currently really enjoying frontend web development and design so this was a good exercise
