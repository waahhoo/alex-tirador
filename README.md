# Svelte + Vite + TailwindCSS

This is my personal website and it was created using Svelte and Vite

## Technical considerations

**Why use this over SvelteKit?**

- Svelte brings its own routing solution which might not be preferable for some users.
- Allegedly deploying to Github Pages is really annoying / not possible (?) with SvelteKit
- It's cool

**Why use this over plain JS, CSS, and HTML?**

- I had just finished working on a project using SvelteKit for an internship and so I was very familiar with Svelte.
- Svelte has a lot of really nice syntax that helps make javascript look so much cleaner and readable.
- Standard HTML and CSS look so ugly so Tailwind is a must (I am not going to spend 20 hours writing out CSS style tags).

## Other Notes

- This is my first time trying to make an actual personal website so it's a bit scuffed
- I'm currently really enjoying frontend web development and design so this was a good exercise
